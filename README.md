# Rockbuster_Sales_SQL
Project completed with Career Foundry for the [fictional] company Rockbuster, an online video rental service. This project is to help the management board answer a series of key business strategy questions that aim to improve sales for 2020.
# What is the Rockbuster Stealth LLC Sales Project?
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.
You’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI)
department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI
department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related
queries. Your first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
# Key Project Questions and Goals
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d like to answer:
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

# About the Code Creator
This project was completed by myself as a part of Career Foundry's Data Analyst certification program, and it is important ot note that this dataset and this company are fictional. However, the codes written and executed are very real and replicable. I began with a raw dataset that needed to be cleaned, checking for any missing data, duplicate data, or privacy related data. The following documents are included and contain the following information:
● Rockbuster Stealth Data Dictionary - Word Document - this dictionary explains all the tables of data contained within the Rockbuster data set, as well as their primary and foreign keys
● Rockbuster Stealth Presentation - Powerpoint Presentation - collective presentation of the data as displayed in graphs and tables highlighting the answers to the projects questions and objectives.
● Rockbuster Stealth Query-Output notebook - Excel Document - explains all queries used to study the data set and are grouped based on their type of analysis - Statistical Analysis (general descriptive statistics), Inventory & Rental (commands to determine information on inventory, rental rates, film counts, etc), and Customer Geographics (where are the top customers, which countries rent what movies, etc)
● Tableau Databook Rockbuster - Excel File - this smaller excel file was used to create various visualizations used in the powerpoint presentation.
